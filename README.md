# Hello world üëã My name is Yuri!

I am a principal software architect with 8 years of an experience in the industry and with more than 17 years of an overall coding experience.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

In my professional life I worked with a crazy amount of different technologies and I truly mastered most of them. Here I want to share the list of techs that I really enjoy to work with. The list is not complete, yet I know all mentioned techs on much higher level than any other developer.

* Programming languages: JVM languages (Java/Groovy/Scala/Clojure...although I am not a big fan of Kotlin), Python, Ruby, C++, C#, JS, Elixir...and on different stages of my life I used Pascal, Object Pascal/Delphi (still play with Lazarus in my free time...nostalgia), Erlang, pure C, Visual Basic (v.6 only), Perl, Lua, Prolog, Dart (I used Flutter before I switched to React Native)
* Frameworks (web/backend): Vert.x (the reason you are here üòÄ), Django (my personal choice when it comes to build web apps for startups), Spring/Spring WebFlux, Flask (for quick prototypes), Rails (when not Django), Akka, Phoenix (pure art)
* Frameworks (web/frontend): Vue.js (my personal choice), React.js, Angular
* Frameworks (others): React Native, Qt (I use it since Symbian...do you remember Symbian?)
* Game Engines (yep!): Godot (my personal preference), Unity, OGRE (I heavily relied on it for visualisations when I worked in a healthcare sector), Cocos2D (was my no.1 before I discovered Godot)
* Databases: PostgreSQL (default DB), MySQL, Oracle, CouchDB, MongoDB, Redis, Neo4J (I ‚ô•Ô∏è graph databases)...and should I mention here also SQLite and Apache Derby?
* Operating systems: *nix in general and MacOS/Ubuntu in particular, yet my first OS was Windows 95
