# Hello world 👋 My name is Yuri!

I am a principal software architect with 8 years of an experience in the industry and with more than 17 years of an overall coding experience.

## 👨‍💻 Tech stack

In my professional life I worked with a crazy amount of different technologies and I truly mastered most of them. Here I want to share the list of techs that I really enjoy to work with. The list is not complete, yet I know all mentioned techs on much higher level than any other developer.

* Programming languages: JVM languages (Java/Groovy/Scala/Clojure), Python, C++/C#, JS, Elixir
* Frameworks (web/backend): Vert.x (the reason you are here 😀), Django, Spring/Spring WebFlux, Akka, Phoenix
* Frameworks (web/frontend): Vue.js, React.js, Angular
* Game Engines (yep!): Godot (my personal preference), Unity
* Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, CouchDB, Neo4J (I ♥️ graph databases)
* Operating systems: *nix in general and MacOS/Ubuntu in particular, yet my first OS was Windows 95
